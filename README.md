repo to study

What did I learn so far:
- creating repository
- creating a branch 
- how commits works (learning rn)

*What is a commit?* Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes so that other contributors can understand what youâ€™ve done and why.
